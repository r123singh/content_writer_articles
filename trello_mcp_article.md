# Created an MCP Server for Trello (100% Open Source) üöÄ

## Overview üìù

I've built a powerful MCP Server for Trello that's completely open source! This innovative server leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a seamless bridge between your applications and Trello. Get ready to supercharge your workflow with these amazing capabilities:

- üìã Managing boards and viewing their details
- üóÇÔ∏è Working with lists and cards
- üÜï Creating and updating cards
- üîÑ Moving cards between lists
- üí¨ Adding comments to cards
- üë• Managing board members

To get started, you'll need:

# Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r123singh/trello-mcp-server.git
```
2. üìÇ cd trello-mcp-server
3. üèóÔ∏è Create a virtual environment:

```
4. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. üì¶ Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. üîê Configure your environment variables:
Create a `.env` file with:
```
TRELLO_API_KEY=your_trello_api_key
TRELLO_API_TOKEN=your_trello_token
```

7. üõ†Ô∏è Configure MCP JSON:
Create a `mcp.json` file with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trello": {
      "command": "{PATH_TO_DIRECTORY}\\trello-mcp-server\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe", 
      "args": [
        "{PATH_TO_DIRECTORY}\\trello-mcp-server\\server.py"

      "env": {
        "TRELLO_API_KEY": "your_trello_api_key",
        "TRELLO_API_TOKEN": "your_trello_token"
