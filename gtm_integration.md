## 🚀 GTM Integration: What’s New and Why It Matters

We’ve taken our GTM setup to the next level, moving beyond basic page views to a comprehensive, event-driven approach. Here’s a breakdown of the enhancements:

### Enhanced GTM Event Tracking

- **Real Data, Real Insights:** We replaced simulated analytics with actual GTM `dataLayer` pushes, ensuring every interaction is captured and sent to your analytics tools.
- **Structured Events:** Events now include `event_category`, `event_action`, and `event_label` for granular reporting and segmentation.
- **Robust Error Handling:** If GTM isn’t loaded, our code gracefully handles it—no more lost data or silent failures.

### Comprehensive Event Coverage

Our integration tracks a wide array of user interactions, including:

- **Page Views:** Captures initial load, user agent, and viewport data for every visitor.
- **Form Interactions:** Monitors focus, blur, submission attempts, and successful completions.
- **Button Clicks:** Differentiates between CTAs, demo requests, downloads, and general buttons.
- **Navigation Events:** Tracks menu clicks, section navigation, and scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
- **Carousel Interactions:** Records slide navigation via dots and keyboard controls.
- **Section Visibility:** Detects when users view specific sections of your site.
- **User Engagement:** Measures time-based engagement to identify your most captivated visitors.
- **External Link Clicks:** Monitors clicks to GitHub and other outbound destinations.

### Powerful Utility Functions

To make custom tracking a breeze, we’ve introduced utility functions:

- `window.gtmUtils.trackCustomEvent()` – Log custom events with detailed data.
- `window.gtmUtils.trackEngagement()` – Track how long users engage with your content.
- `window.gtmUtils.trackFormInteractions()` – Capture granular form field activity.

### Documentation & Transparency

- **Comprehensive README:** Our marketing documentation now details every tracked event, its purpose, and how to use the GTM container (ID: `GTM-5XFLRN8P`).
- **Event Reference:** All tracked events are clearly listed for easy reference and trigger setup.
