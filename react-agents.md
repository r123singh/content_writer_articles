# 🚀 Building a React-Based Multi-Agent System with OpenAI Agents SDK 🤖

Curious about how to bring the power of multi-agent systems into your React applications? OpenAI has provided the OpenAI Agents SDK for TypeScript, making it easier than ever to orchestrate intelligent agents that can collaborate, analyze data, and automate complex workflows—all within a modern web interface. 💡

Benfits of the OpenAI Agents SDK:
1. **Flexible Agent Architecture**: Create agents with different roles and capabilities
2. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: Analyze sensor data and optimize production schedules
3. **Compliance and Reporting**: Generate production reports and ensure compliance documentation
4. **Collaborative Workflow**: Coordinate between agents and resolve conflicts   

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Node.js App** ⚛️  
    Create a new node.js project:
    ```bash
    mkdir multi-agent-system
    cd multi-agent-system
    ```
    Initialize a new node.js project with package.json file and install the dependencies    
   ```bash
    npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install OpenAI Agents SDK** 📦  
   Add the SDK to your project:
   ```bash
    npm install @openai/agents 'zod@<=3.25.67'
   ```
    Explore more about the sdk here - https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/

3. **Design Your Agents** 🛠️  
   Define agent roles and responsibilities—think content generation, decision-making, or coordination. The SDK lets you instantiate and configure agents with custom instructions.

4. **Integrate Agents into React Components** 🔗  
   Use React hooks or context to manage agent state and interactions. Trigger agent actions based on user events or data changes, and display results in real time.

5. **Visualize and Coordinate** 📊🤝  
   Leverage React’s component model to present agent outputs—charts, reports, alerts, and more. You can even coordinate multiple agents to work together, as demonstrated in our manufacturing optimization example.

## 🧩 Example in Action

1. **Multi-Agent System for Industrial Manufacturing Optimization**
- Here I created a multi-agent system for industrial manufacturing optimization as -
    1. **Agent 1**: This agent is responsible for analyzing the production data and optimizing the production schedule.
    2. **Agent 2**: This agent is responsible for generating the production report and ensuring the compliance documentation.
    3. **Agent 3**: This agent is responsible for coordinating the work between the other two agents.
- Core functions used from open ai agents sdk typescript:
    1. **Agent**: This is the main class that represents an agent.
    2. **run**: This function is used to run the agent.
    3. **tools**: This function is used to add tools to the agent.
    4. **memory**: This function is used to add memory to the agent.
